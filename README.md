# SK5-Speaker-Recreation
#The current code is no updated two have 4 buttons: one controls bluetooth connection, one does song skipping, one is a pause/play, and one is the go back button. There is also code for a rotary encoder that can control volume with increments of 5%.

#I also turned off pin verification for bluetooth connection and will automatically pull your device address from the bluetooth connection

#also I use spotify for this and in my device address it is set to /player2, if you are using apple music it will be /player0 but for other i am not sure and that may need to be edited.

# This is the following code for the SK5 Speaker Recreation. The following code controls a raspberry pi 4B with a hifiberry amp2 amplifier connected a single full range speaker to play music. It also controls a display to show the songs meta data, small display that shows the time bar, and buttons to control playback and bluetooth connection.
